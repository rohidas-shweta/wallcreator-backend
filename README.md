In the backend repo, there is an erver.js file where the API is written and the database connection is made.
When the wall is created from the frontend a request is made to the API in the backend then the query is executed to insert the wall parameters including width, height, and depth in the walldata table in the database.

Please find the brief video that demonstrates the workflow :
Plotting two points to create a wall, initially, the wall will be viewed from the top view, now uncheck the create_points checkbox, this will enable the controls and you can view the wall structure in 3D.
When the wall is created the wall dimensions width, height and depth will insert in the walldata table of the database.
